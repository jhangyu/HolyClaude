# Troubleshooting Guide

Solutions to common issues when running HolyClaude.

---

## Common Issues

### CloudCLI shows wrong default directory

**Symptom:** CloudCLI web UI opens to `/home/claude` instead of `/workspace`.

**Cause:** A custom or modified CloudCLI service script did not set `WORKSPACES_ROOT=/workspace` before launching CloudCLI.

**Fix:** Already handled in HolyClaude. The s6 run script uses `with-contenv`, exports `WORKSPACES_ROOT=/workspace`, then starts CloudCLI as the `claude` user. If you've modified the s6 service scripts, keep that export before the `claude-code-ui --port 3001` command.

### SQLite "database is locked" errors

**Symptom:** Constant lock errors from CloudCLI account database or other SQLite databases.

**Cause:** SQLite uses file-level locking that CIFS/SMB doesn't support properly.

**Fix:** Don't store SQLite databases on network mounts. HolyClaude keeps `.cloudcli` in container-local storage for this reason. If you're using your own SQLite databases in `/workspace` on a network mount, move them to a local path.

> If you want the CloudCLI account to persist across rebuilds, use a **named Docker volume** for `/home/claude/.cloudcli` (see the README's Data & Persistence section). Named volumes live on the Docker engine's local filesystem, so SQLite file locking works. Never bind-mount `.cloudcli` to a NAS, SMB, or NFS path.

### Chromium crashes or blank pages

**Symptom:** Playwright tests fail, screenshots are blank, Lighthouse hangs.

**Cause:** Insufficient shared memory.

**Fix:** Ensure `shm_size: 2g` or higher in your docker-compose file. If running many concurrent tabs, increase to `4g`.

---

### File watchers not detecting changes

**Symptom:** Hot reload doesn't work. Dev servers don't pick up file changes.

**Cause:** Running on SMB/CIFS mounts which don't support `inotify`.

**Fix:** Add polling environment variables:
```yaml
environment:
  - CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
  - WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true
```

Note: Polling uses more CPU than inotify. Only enable when needed.

### Permission denied errors

**Symptom:** Can't write files, `git` operations fail, npm install fails.

**Cause:** Usually one of these:

- `PUID`/`PGID` doesn't match your host user
- Docker auto-created `./workspace` as `root:root` on first start because the directory did not exist yet

**Fix:** Set `PUID` and `PGID` to match your host user:
```bash
# On your host, check your IDs
id -u  # This is your PUID
id -g  # This is your PGID
```

Then in your compose file:
```yaml
environment:
  - PUID=1000
  - PGID=1000
```

HolyClaude also auto-fixes the top-level `/workspace` ownership on boot if Docker created it as root. If you still have permission errors after startup, the remaining mismatch is in your host files, not the container's workspace mount point.

### `rm -rf *` doesn't delete dotfiles

**Symptom:** Bootstrap sentinel (`.holyclaude-bootstrapped`) survives deletion, so bootstrap never re-runs.

**Cause:** Bash glob `*` doesn't match dotfiles (files starting with `.`).

**Fix:** Target the sentinel directly:
```bash
rm ./data/claude/.holyclaude-bootstrapped
```

Never delete the entire `./data/claude/` directory — this wipes your credentials.

---

### Docker creates `.claude.json` as a directory

**Symptom:** Claude Code CLI crashes on startup with cryptic errors.

**Cause:** If the bind-mount target doesn't exist as a file before container start, Docker creates it as a directory.

**Fix:** Already handled in `entrypoint.sh` — it pre-creates the file if missing. If you're running a custom setup, ensure `~/.claude.json` exists as a file before starting the container.

---

### Claude Code asks to re-login after rebuild

**Symptom:** After `docker compose down && up`, Claude Code prompts for OAuth / API key again.

**Cause:** Versions before v1.1.7 didn't persist `~/.claude.json`, which holds the Claude Code session state. Container recreation wiped it.

**Fix:** Upgrade to v1.1.7 or later. The session is now auto-saved to `./data/claude/.claude.json.persist` on every boot and every 60 seconds, then restored on the next start. If you're on v1.1.7+ and still losing the session, check that `./data/claude/` is actually writable by the container user (PUID/PGID mismatch).

### Claude Code installer hangs during build

**Symptom:** `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash` hangs indefinitely during `docker build`.

**Cause:** Installer prompts or behaves differently when WORKDIR is root-owned.

**Fix:** Already handled in the Dockerfile — `WORKDIR /workspace` and `USER claude` are set before the installer runs.

---

### Bootstrap doesn't re-run after image update

**Symptom:** New settings/memory from updated image aren't applied.

**Cause:** Sentinel file `.holyclaude-bootstrapped` exists, so bootstrap is skipped.

**Fix:**
```bash
rm ./data/claude/.holyclaude-bootstrapped
docker compose restart holyclaude
```

## SMB/CIFS Gotchas

If your volumes are on a Samba/CIFS network share (common with Hyper-V VMs, NAS devices):

### No inotify support

File watchers must use polling:
```yaml
- CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=1
- WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true
```

### No symlinks (without `mfsymlinks`)

npm global installs and Python `.local` can break. This is why HolyClaude keeps `.npm` and `.local` in container-local storage — don't mount them on network shares.

If you need symlinks on CIFS, add `mfsymlinks` to your mount options:
```
//server/share /mnt/share cifs mfsymlinks,... 0 0
```

### SQLite file locking fails

Any SQLite database on CIFS will get "database is locked" errors. Keep SQLite databases on local storage.

### No Unix permissions

`chmod`/`chown` silently succeed but don't actually change permissions on CIFS (depends on mount options). Use `uid=`, `gid=`, `file_mode=`, `dir_mode=` in mount options to set permissions.

## Getting Help

If your issue isn't covered here:

1. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CoderLuii/HolyClaude/issues) for existing reports
2. Open a new issue with:
   - Your docker-compose file (redact API keys)
   - Output of `docker logs holyclaude`
   - What you expected vs what happened
